# PPSTM (Probe Particle STM)
Code simulating various various STM techniques, especially for tilting tip (dependent on ProkopHapala/ProbeParticleModel)
This is implementation of efficient and simple model for simulation of High-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

* currently developed Python/C++ version of the PPSTM code; 
  * Part of the code is depending on the ProbeParticleModel developed by Prokop Hapala and co. (https://github.com/ProkopHapala/ProbeParticleModel)

works in python2.7, matplotlib, cpp4.4.8, (for some parts ASE and GPAW are imporatant)
