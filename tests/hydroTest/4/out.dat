  In the event that you are searching for an energy 
  minimum, you can also choose energy and force 
  tolerances - energy_tol and force_tol. These tolerances 
  will stop execution after they are achieved. Input a 
  number for all of the following, even if option is not 
  being used! 
  Input energy_tol, force_tol, T_want, taurelax: 
   
  energy tolerance =   1.000000000000000E-004  [eV]
  force tolerance  =   5.000000000000000E-002  [eV/A]
